Week 8 Tasks: Array and ArrayList

1. Write a program that identifies the unique elements in an array of Strings.
		   Example:
		      Input array: {"Java", "Python", "Python", "Ruby", "Ruby", "C#"}

		   Output:
		      Java
		      C#

2. CustomPrint [multidimensional, loop, String, method]

     Create a method that will accept a 2D int array and return a String format of the array.
     Make your own custom print format for this 2D array instead of using the deepToString() method

     Ex:    this is just an example. You can be creative for how the 2D array will be printed
       int [][] nums = {
                {3, 4, 5, 6},
                {5, 2, 6},
                {10, 40, 20}
        };

        output:
            index 0 | (3)(4)(5)(6)
            index 1 | (5)(2)(6)
            index 2 | (10)(40)(20)

3. Given an ArrayList of Strings named 'items', write a program that returns the frequency of each element.
	   Example:
	      Input list: {"Apple", "Banana", "Apple", "Cherry"}

	   Output:
	      Apple = 2
	      Banana = 1
	      Cherry = 1

4. [IQ] Second Biggest Number [ArrayList, loop, conditional]

    Create a program that will have an ArrayList of Integers. Find the second biggest number in the list.
    Note: the 2nd biggest should be unique meaning it should be different from the max number

Example:
    Input:
        [4,3,1,4,5,2,4,8,4,8]
    Output:
        5
