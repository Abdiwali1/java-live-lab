        declare these instance variables:
            super hero name, real name, universe, powers (ArrayList of String)
            make the universe ( universe is referring who makes the movie)

        create a constructor to initialize all the variables

        create an instance method:
            protect() - print $super_hero protecting

        override the toString method

    Create a class Marvel
        inherits SuperHero
        make Marvel

        create a constructor to initialize all the variables by calling the super class constructor
            set universe to "Marvel"

        create a method callAvengers()
            print: Calling all avengers

        override the protect method()
            print: super_hero protecting by any means necessary

    Create a class DC
        inherits SuperHero
        make DC

        declare an instance variable: city

        create a constructor to initialize all the variables by calling the super class constructor
            set universe to "DC"

        override the protect method()
            print: super_hero protecting with honor

    Create a class CheckHeros
    create a main method
    create Marvel and DC objects and test the variables and methods

    data:
    spider man, peter parker, Marvel, powers: Enhanced strength, agility, and spider-sense
    iron man, tony stark, Marvel, powers: powered suit of armor, flight, enhanced strength

Perfect Square [IQ - Amazon]

    Check if the given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that is the result of a number being squared. Squaring a number is multiplying the number itself

    2 squared = 2 * 2 = 4
    5 squared = 5 * 5 = 25
    9 squared = 9 * 9 = 81

    Ex:
        input:
            49
        output:
            true
                7 * 7 gives 49, because the numbers multiplied together are the same 49 is a perfect square

        input:
            85
        output:
            false
                9 * 9 is 81 and 10 * 10 is 100 so 85 is not a perfect square because a number cannot be squared to get that result

Any extra time can be used to review java or git questions
