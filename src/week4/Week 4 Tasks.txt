Operators & Selection Statement Tasks:

1. Create a class named PurchaseCalculator.

 	1.1 Given the following variables:
           - salesTaxRate (double)
           - itemName (String)
           - unitPrice (double)
           - quantity (int)

    1.2 The program should calculate the total cost before tax, the sales tax, and the grand total.

    1.3 The program should display them on the console in the following format:

         Example:
	           itemName = "Fuji Apple"
	           unitPrice = 1.5
	           quantity = 5
	           salesTaxRate = 8

         Output:
	           Item name: Fuji Apple
	           Unit price: $1.5
	           Quantity: 5

	           Total cost before tax: $7.5
	           Sales tax: $0.6
	           ==========================
	           Grand Total: $8.1

2. Create a Java class named MortgageCalculator with the following requirements:

    2.1 Define the following variables:

	        loanAmount: Represents the loan amount.
	        loanTermInYears: Represents the loan term in years.
	        loanType: Represents the type of loan.

    2.2 Determine the annual interest rates for different loan types:

            Fixed:
                30 years: 7.5%
                15 years: 6.9%

            FHA:
                30 years: 7.24%
                15 years: 6.62%

            VA:
                30 years: 6.75%
                15 years: 5.99%

    2.3 Write a program to calculate the monthly mortgage payment using the following formula:

        monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 100 / 12
        numberOfPayments = loanTermInYears * 12
        monthlyPayment = (loanAmount * monthlyInterestRate) / (1 - Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, -numberOfPayments))

    2.4 Display the output in the following format:

            Example 1:
                loanAmount = $500,000
                loanTermInYears = 30
                loanType = "Fixed"

            Output:
                Your monthly mortgage payment for a 30 Yr. Fixed loan is: $3,496.00


    Ensure that the program accurately calculates the monthly mortgage payment based on the
    specified loan amount, term, and type.
